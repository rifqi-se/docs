description: "Guide for transitioning from sandbox to production environment"

## Overview

Once your integration is tested and working in the sandbox environment, you're ready to deploy to production. This guide walks you through the necessary steps to ensure a smooth transition.

## Pre-Production Checklist

Before moving to production, ensure you have completed:

✅ **Thorough Testing** - All API endpoints work correctly in sandbox  
✅ **Error Handling** - Your application handles all error scenarios gracefully  
✅ **VAST Processing** - Your player correctly processes and displays VAST tags  
✅ **Tracking Implementation** - All impression and tracking URLs are properly fired  
✅ **Performance Testing** - Your integration performs well under expected load  

## Production Migration Steps

### 1. Update Base URL

Change from sandbox to production endpoint:

**From (Sandbox):**
```
https://sandbox-ad.playlog.io
```

**To (Production):**
```
https://ad.playlog.io
```

### 2. Replace API Key

**Sandbox Key (Remove):**
```
f9a3c4b7e2d84f85b3a2a1e3c9f071ac
```

**Production Key (Use your actual key):**
- Obtain from your User Settings page
- Or from Display Details page → Connect Player → API Integration

<Warning>
Never use the shared sandbox API key in production. Always use your unique production API key.
</Warning>

### 3. Update Identifiers

Replace test identifiers with your real ones:

| Parameter | Sandbox Value | Production Value |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| `venue_id` | `venue1234` | Your actual venue ID |
| `screen_id` | `any-screen-id` | Your actual screen IDs |

### 4. Production Configuration Example

```bash
# Production API Request
curl -X POST "https://ad.playlog.io/api/v1/ad/request?format=json" \
  -H "Lynx-Key: your-production-api-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "venue_id": "your-actual-venue-id",
    "screen_id": "your-actual-screen-id",
    "play_time": 1698451200
  }'
```
