## Overview

The Ad Serving API offers media owners a RESTful HTTP interface, enabling them to request ads, receive ad responses, report proof of plays (PoPs) and fired URL Tracking. This API serves as the bridge between your digital out-of-home (DOOH) inventory and the Lynx SSP platform, allowing for real-time ad delivery and comprehensive tracking.
