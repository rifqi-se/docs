### Programmatic

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a Programmatic Campaign?">
    A programmatic campaign is a type of campaign sale that allows you, as a media owner, to sell your Digital-Out-of-Home (DOOH) inventory automatically through an SSP (Supply-Side Platform), thereby maximizing your revenue potential.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the advantages or benefits of programmatic advertising for publishers or media owners?">
    Programmatic enables more optimal monetization of DOOH inventory through an automated advertising bidding and purchasing process using Real-Time Bidding (RTB) and data-driven technology.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is different between regular (direct) campaigns with programmatic?">
    Regular (direct) campaigns are conducted directly between advertisers and publishers, involving manual negotiations on price, display duration, and selected locations. Meanwhile, programmatic purchases are conducted automatically using a system and auction process that utilizes Real-Time Bidding (RTB), which is carried out entirely on the Ad Server. This makes it more efficient, data-driven, and enables real-time targeting and optimization of campaign sales.

  <Accordion title="What is Real-Time Bidding (RTB)?">
    RTB (Real-Time Bidding) is an automated auction process in a programmatic system that takes place in milliseconds to determine which advertiser's ad or campaign will be displayed on a particular DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) inventory.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is an Ad Server?">
    An Ad Server is a system that manages and displays ads automatically based on Real Time Bidding (RTB) auction results to display programmatic campaigns from advertisers running on your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) inventory, while also recording performance data such as impressions, spend rate, revenue, etc.

    You can access the Ad Server in the Lynx SSP Ad Exchange feature.
