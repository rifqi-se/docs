  <Accordion title="What is a Programmatic Campaign?">
    A programmatic campaign is a type of campaign sale that allows you, as a media owner, to sell your Digital-Out-of-Home (DOOH) inventory automatically through an SSP (Supply-Side Platform), thereby maximizing your revenue potential.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the advantages or benefits of programmatic advertising for publishers or media owners?">
    Programmatic enables more optimal monetization of DOOH inventory through an automated advertising bidding and purchasing process using Real-Time Bidding (RTB) and data-driven technology.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is different between regular (direct) campaigns with programmatic?">
    Regular (direct) campaigns are conducted directly between advertisers and publishers, involving manual negotiations on price, display duration, and selected locations. Meanwhile, programmatic purchases are conducted automatically using a system and auction process that utilizes Real-Time Bidding (RTB), which is carried out entirely on the Ad Server. This makes it more efficient, data-driven, and enables real-time targeting and optimization of campaign sales.
