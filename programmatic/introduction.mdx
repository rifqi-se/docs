**Programmatic** is a feature on the Lynx SSP Platform that allows you, as a Media Owner, to register and manage all your DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory so that it can be sold and made available automatically, thereby maximizing revenue potential without the need for manual processes with advertisers. Simply put, this feature facilitates real-time, automated digital campaign transactions, connecting you or the Media Owner from Lynx SSP as the Supply-Side Platform with various Advertisers from DSP (Demand-Side Platform) to sell your available inventory.

This page helps you understand the process involved in the Programmatic ads.

## Direct (Regular) vs Programmatic Campaign

Currently, in the digital campaign ecosystem, there are two main methods for buying and selling ad inventory: **Direct Campaign** (direct purchase), better known in the Lynx SSP Platform as **Campaign Regular** <u>(see Campaign Management (Regular))</u>**,** and **Programmatic Campaign.** Understanding the differences between the two is essential for optimizing strategies and achieving campaign goals.

## Programmatic Process

The programmatic process on the Lynx SSP platform consists of the following series of processes:

![Programmatic Process Pn](/images/programmatic/ProgrammaticProcess.png)

**Case Example:**

Inventory A has 4 slots, 3 slots are filled with Regular Campaigns, and there is still 1 slot available (filled with filler). To maximize revenue and fill the 1 available slot in Inventory A, the Media Owner activates the Inventory to programmatic [**<u>(See Set DOOH Inventory to Programmatic)</u>**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6tZTWVR0W4hJ79wxaBbyLbRIl3UPT6-gAS4SQFhpj0/edit?tab=t.7c7miyyfcq7u)\*\* \*\*and create a Deal [**<u>(See Deal Management)</u>**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6tZTWVR0W4hJ79wxaBbyLbRIl3UPT6-gAS4SQFhpj0/edit?tab=t.q8f25gp8l18i). Based on the programmatic process flow described above, the scenario is as follows:

1. DSP provides Ad Response and Bid Price \> Floor Price = Displays Creative Content.
2. DSP provides Ad Response and Bid Price \< Floor Price = Displays Filler.
3. DSP does not provide Ad Response at all / timeout = Displays Filler.
