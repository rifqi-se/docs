API is one of the connection bridges between the **Lynx SSP Platform** and your **DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory**. The Ad Serving API offers media owners a RESTful HTTP interface, enabling them to request ads, receive ad responses, report proof of plays (PoPs) and fired URL Tracking.

## Connecting Inventory with Ad Serving API

1. Go to the **"Screens"** section on the Display Details page.
2. Click the **"Connect Player"** button and select **"API Integration"**.
3. Copy the **API Secret Key** for your production environment.

You can also obtain your api_key from the **User Settings** page. This page also provides the API base URLs required for integration.

<Warning>
Your api_key is private and should never be shared with third parties. Treat it like a password to prevent unauthorized access to your account.
