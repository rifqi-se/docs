Ensure you have added DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory on the Lynx SSP Platform ([See Creating a DOOH Inventory ↗](/guideline/screen-connection/screen-app/create-dooh-inventory/create)).

## Overview

By default, after adding DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory, you can see the Screen Status in the form “Not Connected” ([See Screen Status ↗]()) and Connection Type **“-”** ([See Connection Type ↗]()). This indicates that the DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory on the Lynx SSP Platform is not yet connected to the Screen. Therefore, further configuration is required by connecting the DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) Inventory that has been added with the Player to display creative content and filler campaigns.
