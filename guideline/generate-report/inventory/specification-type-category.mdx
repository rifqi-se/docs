## Specification

<p class="text-sm">
Specifications are a new classification within the Display Specification for media inventory that you must fill out to categorize media inventory based on its ad placement location. This classification aims to group ad media based on where the ad is placed and how it reaches the audience.</p>

<p class="text-sm">
Inventory consists of three specifications:</p>

### Roadside

<p class="text-sm">
Roadside is an inventory media placed along highways, main roads, and high-traffic areas, such as billboards. This media is intended to capture the attention of passing motorists and pedestrians.</p>

## Type & Category

<p class="text-sm">
There are two types of inventory that can be added to the Lynx SSP: DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home) and OOH (Out-of-Home) Inventory. </p>

<p class="text-sm">
Here are the definitions for each type:</p>

### DOOH (Digital-Out-of-Home)

<p class="text-sm">
This is a type of digital outdoor media that uses electronic screens to display advertisements or content. Examples include digital billboards (known as videotron), mobile LEDs, etc. DOOH allows for content to be managed in a real-time and flexible manner.</p>

### OOH (Out-of-Home)

<p class="text-sm">
This is a conventional, static form of outdoor media. Examples include billboards, banners, posters, and other printed outdoor media. OOH displays advertising materials in a fixed, printed visual format.</p>
