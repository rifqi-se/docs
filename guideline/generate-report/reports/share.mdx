Another way you can use ([See Download Campaign Report ↗](/guideline/generate-report/reports/download)) to give clients access to view Campaign Reports is to provide a link from the campaign report web page (URL link) that they can access through a browser with internet support. 

To get the URL link and keyword (which will later be given to clients), you only need to press “Share” on the report page and a pop-up modal will appear asking you to enter the keyword from your account.

This page will help you in sharing campaign reports.
