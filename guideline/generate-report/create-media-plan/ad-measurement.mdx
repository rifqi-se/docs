**Ad Measurement** is the calculation method used by each inventory item to measure and analyze the performance of a campaign running on that inventory. Ad Measurement helps to determine how well an advertisement works in achieving its established goals.

<Info>
  The selection of **Ad Measurement** can only be performed if the media plan has a status of **Launched** ([See Launch Media Plan ↗](/guideline/generate-report/create-media-plan/launch-media-plan)).

    You can select Ad Measurement, and there are two options available:

    <Accordion title="Circulation">
      Circulation is a measure that provides an estimate of the maximum number of people who potentially could see an advertisement. It is a broad metric that focuses on potential reach, not actual interaction or viewings. Due to its broad nature, circulation tends to result in a larger number of impressions, but it is less accurate in measuring whether the advertisement was actually seen by the audience.

      Example: The number of readers that a magazine could reach. If a magazine has a circulation of 50,000, it means 50,000 copies have been distributed. However, this does not guarantee that all 50,000 people will open the page or see your advertisement.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Real Opportunity to See (ROTS)">
      Real Opportunity to See (ROTS) is a metric that is more sophisticated and generally more accurate than circulation. This metric estimates the number of people who actually have a real opportunity to see and interact with the advertisement. Unlike circulation, which only measures potential, ROTS attempts to measure viewership that is more precise and closer to reality.

      To determine ROTS, additional data is often required, such as direction facing ([See Creating  a DOOH Inventory ↗](/guideline/generate-report/create-inventory/dooh/create)), which allows the system to understand whether an advertisement is within the audience's line of sight. By incorporating factors like these, ROTS provides a more accurate picture of how effectively an advertisement is reaching its audience. In short, ROTS provides fewer impressions, but they are of higher quality and greater precision.
