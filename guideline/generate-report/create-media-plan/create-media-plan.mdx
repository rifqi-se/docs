A **Media Plan** is a setting within a campaign that allows users to segment a slightly more complex client brief.

For example, if a client from Brand A wants to advertise on your billboards in Cities A, B, and C with a variety of different billboards, instead of creating four separate campaigns, you can manage the campaign structure with just one campaign, as shown in the example below.

With the campaign management structure above, you only need to create one campaign. And of course, the campaign result report can be accessed based on the Media Plan and the Inventory or Billboard that have been created and selected.

## Accessing the Media Plan

After completing the campaign creation (**See Creating a Campaign**), you will be directed to the **Media Plan** page to continue configuring the details of your campaign.

Additionally, you can access it through the following steps:
