A **Media Plan** is a setting within a campaign that allows users to segment a slightly more complex client brief.

For example, if a client from Brand A wants to advertise on your billboards in Cities A, B, and C with a variety of different billboards, instead of creating four separate campaigns, you can manage the campaign structure with just one campaign, as shown in the example below.

With the campaign management structure above, you only need to create one campaign. And of course, the campaign result report can be accessed based on the Media Plan and the Inventory or Billboard that have been created and selected.

## Accessing the Media Plan

After completing the campaign creation ([See Create Campaign ↗](/guideline/generate-report/create-campaign/create)), you will be directed to the **Media Plan** page to continue configuring the details of your campaign.

Additionally, you can access it through the following steps:

## Create a Media Plan

After creating a new campaign, you must create a **Media Plan** so that your campaign can run and meet the specifications provided by the client. The following are the steps for creating a media plan:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Media Plan' Button">
    ![Create Media Plan 1 Pn](/images/CreateMediaPlan-1.png)

    This will display a modal where you can enter the name for the media plan.

    ![Create Media Plan 1 2 Pn](/images/CreateMediaPlan-1.2.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Media Plan Name">
    Example: create and manage a media plan named 'New Product Snack ABC - South Jakarta' to map the media plan inventory points or billboards running in the South Jakarta area

  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the 'Save Changes' Button">
    ![Create Media Plan 3 Pn](/images/CreateMediaPlan-3.png)

    Then the media plan has been successfully created.

    After successfully creating the media plan, its default status will be 'Draft'. You can continue configuring the media plan by changing the schedule if necessary ([See Edit Schedule ↗](/guideline/generate-report/create-media-plan/schedule/edit)). If there are no changes to the media plan schedules, you can proceed directly to selecting the Inventory that will run your campaign ([See Select Inventories ↗] (/guideline/generate-report/create-media-plan/select-inventories)).
  </Step>
</Steps>
