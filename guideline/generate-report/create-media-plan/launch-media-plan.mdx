**Launching the Media Plan (Launch)** is an action that signifies that the campaign you created is ready to begin. Once this process is complete, it will change the **Campaign status** from '**Not Started**' to **'Running'** and change the **Media Plan status** from '**Draft**' to **'Launched'**.

The system will automatically recognize the start time for all media plans within a campaign and will begin recording the acquired **impression, reach, frequency**, etc., for that campaign.

This page will help you with how to launch a campaign's media plan.

After completing the media plan creation process, including setting the schedule and selecting the inventory, the next step is to **launch the media plan** through the following steps:

<Info>
  The launch process is performed for each individual media plan. So, if you have three media plans within a single campaign, you must perform the Launch process three separate times if all those media plans are ready to be used.
