After creating the media plan, you will first be directed to the **Schedule Tab**. The Schedule displays the **period or duration** of the media plan. By default, the period or **date duration** follows the duration of the campaign created previously (See [Create Campaign](/guideline/generate-report/create-campaign/create)). Meanwhile, the **time settings** are set to a full 24 hours, and the **day settings** indicate all days of the week for the media plan to run.

If there are changes to the schedule, you can modify the media plan schedule according to the campaign preferences you need. This page will help you understand the Schedule Tab and make edits within that menu.

    In this section, you can view the **schedules** for your media plan. By default, there is **one schedule** that is created automatically when you make a new media plan. This date range refers to the duration of the campaign that the media plan is part of.

    This media plan schedule is used as the **reference** for when the creative content (advertisement) begins to play and for recording the **impressions, reach, and frequency** obtained from that advertisement.

    The schedule properties that can be seen in this table are as follows:

    - **Date Duration**
    - **Time Settings**
    - **Day Settings**
