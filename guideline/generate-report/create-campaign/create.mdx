## Add New Campaign Form

When creating a campaign on the Lynx SSP Platform, you'll need to prepare and enter several pieces of information or data into the following form:

![Add New Campaign Form Pn](/images/AddNewCampaignForm.png)

Based on the form above, the information or data required to create a new campaign is as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Campaign Name (Required)">
    You can enter the **Campaign Name** that you are creating or managing.

    <Note>
      The campaign name you use cannot be a duplicate. When you enter a campaign name that has been used before and is still in the system, the system will issue a warning that the campaign name cannot be used.
    </Note>
    Example: You will create and manage a campaign named "New Product Snack ABC" to promote the latest product from Snack ABC.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Campaign Type (Required)">
    You must choose one of the two types a campaign can have: Regular or Exclusive (See Campaign Type).

    ![Add New Campaign Form 2 Pn](/images/AddNewCampaignForm-2.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Duration (Required)">
    A campaign has a scheduled period for when it starts and when it ends. You must select the duration range or schedule for the campaign. The format used for this schedule is dd/MM/yyyy ~ dd/MM/yyyy.

    Example: The duration for New Product Snack ABC is from October 01, 2025 - October 31, 2025.

    <Warning>
      The chosen campaign duration will be used when you filter the Campaign Report page. The date range that will be active as a filter on the campaign report page is the range from the campaign's duration ([See Campaign Report ↗](/guideline/generate-report/reports/reports)).
